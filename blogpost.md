An analysis of the paper and its key components. Think about it as a nicely formatted review as you would see on OpenReview.net. It should contain one paragraph of related work as well.

## Exposition of its weaknesses/strengths/potential which triggered your group to come up with a response.


## Describe your novel contribution.

## Results of your work (link that part with the code in the jupyter notebook)

## Conclude

## Close the notebook with a description of each student's contribution.

Clarification last bullet point:
The idea here is that you will need to inform us about the individual contribution to the project. Firstly, by splitting the tasks and uploading the project proposal, and secondly, at the end course, with the submission of the tutorial.

That can be done in an appendix session in the blogpost or via a supplementary pdf document with the team contribution. Note that in the main markdown file, you can also have an appendix with additional information (for instance the student description). In that case, the appendix will be exempted from the rule of 20 mins.
